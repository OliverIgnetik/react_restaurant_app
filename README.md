# Restaurant React App

Simple `react` application with firebase API, sign-in authentication, `react-router-dom` routing and globalized state management using `react-redux`.

This application emulates a basic restaurant website for ordering food.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- Client side rendered `react` application using `redux-thunk` for asynchronous requests with `axios`
- Users can login with an authorization system to purchase a food item customized to their choice
- Logs orders on database
- Robust error handling and form control
- Responsive design for all devices

### Bonus Hooks implementation

This repository includes a react hooks implementation (`./react_hooks_implementation`) for pedagogical purposes. This implementation is included to show a functional aproach vs the class based approach that has been deployed on `gh-pages`.

## Future Work

- Improve visual design of the website
- Include simulation of order delivery
